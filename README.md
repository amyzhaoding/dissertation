With many management scholars active on Twitter, sometimes there are brilliant Twitter threads talking about interesting business phenomena, how to teach and do research, which could be helpful to many PhD students and junior scholars.

## Technological disruption & incumbents
See https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1095373469875867648 for the actual thread  

@emollick: Great summary of three major academic theories about why companies like Kodak or Nokia don’t see change coming by @BarnettTalks (Whispers) Psst, startups, these are also your avenues of attack if you want to go after an established giant though disruption 

@ewzucker: Except Kodak did see it coming... (hence as @BarnettTalks notes, the invention of the digital camera). (When I teach it, I rely on a combo of theories 1 & 2 and a couple of other ideas not reviewed here, incl internal competition <captured well in Bresnahan/Greenstein/Henderson>)

@emollick: I guess it depends by "See it coming." Most companies see the technology coming, but they don't see change coming as quickly as it does.

@ewzucker: Right but in this case, they not only saw it but *acted* upon it— ineptly & way too soon. Invested way too much too early ($1B in digital R&D in the eighties, which is why they generated such a huge patent portfolio)

@jamescham: Tim Harford did a great job of summarizing Henderson and @joshgans research. One question I ask myself as a VC is whether the new thing is like a tank or laser printer.

@ewzucker: As I recall, the Harford piece is useful but among other things, it mushes together Henderson & Clark and Bresnahan-Greenstein-Henderson.  Each piece introduces a distinct (if complementary) idea about why incumbents run into trouble.

@brentdg2: I’m tired of the Kodak myth. Kodak was a chemical company in an oligopoly that made low end cameras. Digital = low margin competition with multiple OEMs. Why make that transition anyway? BTW, Kodak survived. It’s called “Eastman” today
@emollick: So what's the canonical example now of missing the boat? It's not buggy whips...

@ewzucker: Ha yeah.  I also love telling students that we should stop dunking on the buggy whip makers for missing the transition to cars since the smart moves were a) ride into the sunset (ouch); or b) leverage their complementary assets into new opportunities like Fuji (& Hermes!!) did
